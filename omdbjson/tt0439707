Taking along wife Gina and son Vincent, Carmine enters the federal witness relocation program and is given a new home and identity. Now known as the Cheeseman family from Omaha, Nebraska, these former East Coast mobsters are relocated into the middle of a quiet, strait-laced Mormon community in Utah where Carmine can't even find a decent cup of coffee, let alone a horse track, and he is not happy. Life in this small town becomes anything but ordinary once the Cheesemans move in. Many locals are wary, if not outright afraid, of these rough-around-the-edges outsiders, while others go annoyingly far out their way to try to embrace them. Despite well-meaning neighbor Michael Jaymes' efforts to welcome Carmine, he wonders if being this much of a fish-out-of-water is truly better than \"sleeping with the fishes.\"","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1OTUzMTMwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTUzMDkzMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.1/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"75%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"6.1","imdbVotes":"755","imdbID":"tt0439707","Type":"movie","DVD":"13 Dec 2005","BoxOffice":"$409,604","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
