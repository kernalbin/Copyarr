Harry is snatched away from his mundane existence by Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), the groundskeeper for Hogwarts, and quickly thrown into a world completely foreign to both him and the viewer. Famous for an incident that happened at his birth, Harry makes friends easily at his new school. He soon finds, however, that the wizarding world is far more dangerous for him than he would have imagined, and he quickly learns that not all wizards are ones to be trusted.","Language":"English, Latin","Country":"United Kingdom, United States","Awards":"Nominated for 3 Oscars. 19 wins & 69 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ0ODBhMjUtNDRhOC00MGQzLTk5MTAtZDliODg5NmU5MjZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDUyOTg3Njg@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"81%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"65/100"}],"Metascore":"65","imdbRating":"7.6","imdbVotes":"809,596","imdbID":"tt0241527","Type":"movie","DVD":"28 May 2002","BoxOffice":"$318,886,962","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
