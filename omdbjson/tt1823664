Abandoned by her biological parents as a baby, Annie (Wallis) spends every moment of every day attempting to avoid the wrath of her cruel foster mother Miss Colleen Hannigan (Cameron Diaz). Thing start to look up for Annie, however, when she has a very public encounter with Will Stacks (Foxx), a local cell-phone mogul with mayoral ambitions. Stacks' campaign isn't going too well until he meets Annie and invites her into his home at the suggestion of his trusted top assistant Grace (Rose Byrne) and his ambitious PR advisor Guy (Bobby Cannavale). Meanwhile, what was originally conceived as a PR stunt to win over skeptical voters becomes something much more personal when the jaded tycoon realizes his little friend is much more than a mere good-luck charm.","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"3 wins & 18 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAyNDYxOTI4MzNeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDQ3MDU3NjIx._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.3/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"28%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"33/100"}],"Metascore":"33","imdbRating":"5.3","imdbVotes":"39,247","imdbID":"tt1823664","Type":"movie","DVD":"17 Mar 2015","BoxOffice":"$85,911,262","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
