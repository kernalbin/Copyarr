The child, crippled in a terrible accident, has always treasured his shepherd father's tale of that starlit night so many years before - a night filled with the wonder of angelic heralds and a tiny Bethlehem stable sheltering the chosen Messiah.

When he meets the gentle stranger in the hills - a man strangely familiar to him - the faithful young shepherd encounters a miracle of his own.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDAxZTExYzItYjcxMS00ZThlLThiMWUtN2ZmOGI3Y2ZmMGVlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDgxNzcyNDU@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.7/10"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"6.7","imdbVotes":"58","imdbID":"tt3898698","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
