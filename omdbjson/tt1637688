You stop aging at 25, but there's a catch: you're genetically-engineered to live only one more year, unless you can buy your way out of it. The rich \"earn\" decades at a time (remaining at age 25), becoming essentially immortal, while the rest beg, borrow or steal enough hours to make it through the day. When a man from the wrong side of the tracks is falsely accused of murder, he is forced to go on the run with a beautiful hostage. Living minute to minute, the duo's love becomes a powerful tool in their war against the system.","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"2 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA3NzI1ODc1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzI5NjQwNg@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.7/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"37%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"53/100"}],"Metascore":"53","imdbRating":"6.7","imdbVotes":"423,388","imdbID":"tt1637688","Type":"movie","DVD":"31 Jan 2012","BoxOffice":"$37,520,095","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
