This spice \"MELANGE\" is said to only be produced in the desert planet of Arrakis, where the FREMEN people have the prophecy of a man who will lead them to true freedom. This \"desert planet\"of Arrakis is also known as DUNE. A secret report of the space \"GUILD\" talks about some circumstances and plans that could jeopardize the production of \"SPICE\" with four planets involved: ARRAKIS, CALADAN, GIEDI PRIME and KAITAIN, a world at least visually very alike to Earth and house of the Emperor of the known Universe. The \"GUILD\" sends a third stage navigator to KAITAIN to ask details from the Emperor and to demand him the killing of young Paul Atreides, son of the Duke Leto Atreides of CALADAN.","Language":"English","Country":"United States, Mexico","Awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar. 2 wins & 5 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTAzYzNlMDMtMGRjYS00M2UxLTk0MmEtYmE4YWZiYmEwOTIwL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzc5MjA3OA@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.3/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"43%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"41/100"}],"Metascore":"41","imdbRating":"6.3","imdbVotes":"165,701","imdbID":"tt0087182","Type":"movie","DVD":"16 Aug 2011","BoxOffice":"$30,925,690","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
