Joe is diagnosed with an incurable disease, quits his dehumanizing job, and accepts an offer to briefly \"live like a king, die like a man\" - but to fulfill his agreement he must willingly jump into a live volcano on the island of Waponi Woo in order to appease the volcano god. En route to the island, Joe meets a series of interesting characters in NYC and LA, then boards a yacht, captained by Patricia Graynamore. During the voyage Joe and Patricia survive disaster, fall in love, and finally arrive at the island where they face their destiny.","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"1 nomination","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWViOTc3M2ItZDI5Yy00OGMwLWEyYzMtNGY5NDBhMTkyZDkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.9/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"65%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"45/100"}],"Metascore":"45","imdbRating":"5.9","imdbVotes":"38,628","imdbID":"tt0099892","Type":"movie","DVD":"02 Apr 2002","BoxOffice":"$39,404,261","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
