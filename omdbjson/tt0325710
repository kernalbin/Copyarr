The Imperial Omura (Masato Harada) cabinet's first priority is to repress a rebellion of traditionalist Samurai, hereditary warriors, who remain devoted to the sacred dynasty, but reject the Westernizing policy, and even refuse firearms. Yet, when his ill-prepared superior force sets out too soon, their panic allows the sword-wielding samurai to crush them. Badly wounded, Algren's courageous stand makes the samurai leader Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) spare his life. Once nursed to health, he learns to know and respect the old Japanese way, and participates as advisor in Katsumoto's failed attempt to save the Bushido tradition, but Omura gets repressive laws enacted. He must now choose to honor his loyalty to one of the embittered sides when the conflict returns to the battlefield.","Language":"English, Japanese","Country":"United States, New Zealand, Japan","Awards":"Nominated for 4 Oscars. 20 wins & 67 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzkyNzQ1Mzc0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODg3MzUzMw@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.8/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"66%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"55/100"}],"Metascore":"55","imdbRating":"7.8","imdbVotes":"452,698","imdbID":"tt0325710","Type":"movie","DVD":"05 Apr 2005","BoxOffice":"$111,127,263","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
