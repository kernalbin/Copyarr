However, his macho father and village leader, Stoik the Vast, will not allow his small, clumsy, but inventive son to do so. Regardless, Hiccup ventures out into battle and downs a mysterious Night Fury dragon with his invention, but can't bring himself to kill it. Instead, Hiccup and the dragon, whom he dubs Toothless, begin a friendship that would open up both their worlds as the observant boy learns that his people have misjudged the species. But even as the two each take flight in their own way, they find that they must fight the destructive ignorance plaguing their world.","Language":"English","Country":"United States, France","Awards":"Nominated for 2 Oscars. 25 wins & 63 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5NDQyMjc2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjg5ODcyMw@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.1/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"99%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"75/100"}],"Metascore":"75","imdbRating":"8.1","imdbVotes":"761,919","imdbID":"tt0892769","Type":"movie","DVD":"17 Aug 2010","BoxOffice":"$217,581,231","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
