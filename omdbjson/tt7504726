As a newcomer to the dog team delivery service - and not before long their front-runner - Buck, a dog like no other, who had been spoiled, and who had suffered, but he could not be broken, is having the time of his life. Forced to fight to survive, eventually taken by his last owner, John Thornton, to proximity of the Arctic Circle, somewhere between Yukon and Alaska, he progressively depends on his primal instincts, sheds the comforts of civilization and responds to \"the call of the wild\", as master of his own.","Language":"English, French","Country":"United States","Awards":"1 win & 8 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDA1ZmQ2OGMtZDhkMC00ZjRkLWE3ZTMtMzA5ZTk0YjM1OGRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzI1NzMxNzM@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.7/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"63%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"48/100"}],"Metascore":"48","imdbRating":"6.7","imdbVotes":"52,616","imdbID":"tt7504726","Type":"movie","DVD":"27 Mar 2020","BoxOffice":"$62,342,368","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
