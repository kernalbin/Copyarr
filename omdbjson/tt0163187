Fearing a legal case from Maggie, Ike's editor and ex Ellie fires him. Staff buddy Fisher cues Ike to seek his job back (or earn another) by attempting to prove the alleged inaccuracies and/or writing a priceless follow-up piece. So his sports-car heads for her home Hale, where she runs a garage and designs glassware. His charms and journalistic nose get everyone to open up and reveal her embarrassing past before she can swear people to silence, from her three dumped grooms and family to her overconfident present groom, high school coach Bob Kelly. In the process, Maggie finds hating him as hard as tempting, while Ike develops a strange appreciation for the maverick, until even Bob sees reason to get jealous.","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"6 wins & 11 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjg3MGIwYTctMDllOC00ZmQ5LThiNmYtYjYxNzEyNTA3ZjdlL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"46%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"39/100"}],"Metascore":"39","imdbRating":"5.6","imdbVotes":"101,387","imdbID":"tt0163187","Type":"movie","DVD":"25 Jan 2000","BoxOffice":"$152,257,509","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
