She lives a sheltered life and is shy and unfulfilled. When she gets caught in a snowstorm while chasing her dog Toto, they're transported to the mysterious Land of Oz, where she's informed that the only way she can find her way home is through the assistance of the powerful wizard in the Emerald City. As she searches for him by easing down the Yellow Brick Road, she befriends some creatures who face problems in their lives. In their quest to find the wizard, they also face Evillene, the equally evil sister of Evermean, the wicked witch whom Dorothy inadvertently killed when she arrived in Oz; Evillene might be their biggest obstacle.","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"Nominated for 4 Oscars. 2 wins & 11 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzU0YzkzYjItOThjNi00NTU4LWIxZDEtN2U4NmFkMGFiOWI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA0MjU0Ng@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.5/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"41%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"53/100"}],"Metascore":"53","imdbRating":"5.5","imdbVotes":"15,975","imdbID":"tt0078504","Type":"movie","DVD":"03 Feb 2009","BoxOffice":"$21,049,053","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
