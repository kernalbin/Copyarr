He's been pushing for an assignment on the island for personal reasons, but before long he thinks he's been brought there as part of a twisted plot by hospital doctors whose radical treatments range from unethical to illegal to downright sinister. Teddy's shrewd investigating skills soon provide a promising lead, but the hospital refuses him access to records he suspects would break the case wide open. As a hurricane cuts off communication with the mainland, more dangerous criminals \"escape\" in the confusion, and the puzzling, improbable clues multiply, Teddy begins to doubt everything - his memory, his partner, even his own sanity.","Language":"English, German","Country":"United States","Awards":"11 wins & 66 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzhiNDkyNzktNTZmYS00ZTBkLTk2MDAtM2U0YjU1MzgxZjgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.2/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"68%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"63/100"}],"Metascore":"63","imdbRating":"8.2","imdbVotes":"1,359,603","imdbID":"tt1130884","Type":"movie","DVD":"08 Jun 2010","BoxOffice":"$128,012,934","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
