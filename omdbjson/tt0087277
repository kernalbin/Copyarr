When teenager Ren McCormack and his family move from big-city Chicago to a small Midwestern town, he's in for a real case of culture shock. Though he tries hard to fit in, the streetwise Ren can't quite believe he's living in a place where rock music and dancing are illegal. However, there is one small pleasure: Ariel Moore, a troubled but lovely blonde with a jealous boyfriend. And a Bible-thumping minister, who is responsible for keeping the town dance-free. Ren and his classmates want to do away with this ordinance, especially since the senior prom is around the corner, but only Ren has the courage to initiate a battle to abolish the outmoded ban and revitalize the spirit of the repressed townspeople. Fast-paced drama is filled with such now-famous hit songs as the title track and \"Let's Hear It for the Boy\".","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"Nominated for 2 Oscars. 2 wins & 6 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGZjZWRlNjYtMDM3Ny00N2M4LWFjZDYtYmM3NWZmMDUwYzUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzMDUzNTI3._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"52%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"42/100"}],"Metascore":"42","imdbRating":"6.6","imdbVotes":"85,702","imdbID":"tt0087277","Type":"movie","DVD":"08 Oct 2002","BoxOffice":"$80,035,402","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
