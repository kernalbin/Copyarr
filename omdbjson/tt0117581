Unaware of his dad's dangerous, yet exciting, secret identity, Jeremy's world is utterly normal. But all that changes when Ray returns from a mission, bringing with him a high-powered laser gun he stole from a treacherous female foreign guns dealer. Ray tells his son the gun is only a toy, but his secret comes out when the dealer sends her henchmen to capture Ray and retrieve the gun. The nasty henchmen get Ray, but Jeremy escapes with the wanted firearm. After he learns how to use the laser gun, Jeremy gathers his friends, and together they hatch a clever plan to rescue Ray.","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2I1MmUxMmYtYTQyOS00ZTBkLTg5ZTctMTQyNzEwMzk4NmY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQ3Njg3MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"3.3/10"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"3.3","imdbVotes":"1,396","imdbID":"tt0117581","Type":"movie","DVD":"01 Feb 2005","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
