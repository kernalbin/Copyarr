But in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Peter Parker finds that his greatest battle is about to begin. It's great to be Spider-Man. For Peter Parker, there's no feeling quite like swinging between skyscrapers, embracing being the hero, and spending time with Gwen. But being Spider-Man comes at a price: only Spider-Man can protect his fellow New Yorkers from the formidable villains that threaten the city. With the emergence of Electro, Peter must confront a foe far more powerful than he. And as his old friend, Harry Osborn, returns, Peter comes to realize that all of his enemies have one thing in common: Oscorp.","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"4 wins & 30 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTA5NDYxNTg0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODE5NzU1MTE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"51%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"53/100"}],"Metascore":"53","imdbRating":"6.6","imdbVotes":"512,852","imdbID":"tt1872181","Type":"movie","DVD":"19 Aug 2014","BoxOffice":"$202,853,933","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
