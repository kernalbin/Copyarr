Aibileen (Davis), Skeeter's best friend's housekeeper, is the first to open up -- to the dismay of her friends in the tight-knit black community. Despite Skeeter's life-long friendships hanging in the balance, she and Aibileen continue their collaboration and soon more women come forward to tell their stories -- and as it turns out, they have a lot to say. Along the way, unlikely friendships are forged and a new sisterhood emerges, but not before everyone in town has a thing or two to say themselves when they become unwittingly -- and unwillingly -- caught up in the changing times.","Language":"English","Country":"United States, India","Awards":"Won 1 Oscar. 79 wins & 121 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5OTMyMjIxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzU4MjIwNQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.1/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"76%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"62/100"}],"Metascore":"62","imdbRating":"8.1","imdbVotes":"472,760","imdbID":"tt1454029","Type":"movie","DVD":"06 Dec 2011","BoxOffice":"$169,708,112","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
