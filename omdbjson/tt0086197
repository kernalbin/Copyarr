It covers the breaking of the sound barrier by Chuck Yeager to the Mercury 7 astronauts, showing that no one had a clue how to run a space program or how to select people to be in it. Thrilling, funny, charming and electrifying all at once.","Language":"English, Russian, Spanish","Country":"United States","Awards":"Won 4 Oscars. 11 wins & 16 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTUwMDA3MTYtZjhjMi00ODFmLTg5ZTAtYzgwN2NlODgzMmUwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.8/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"96%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"91/100"}],"Metascore":"91","imdbRating":"7.8","imdbVotes":"63,370","imdbID":"tt0086197","Type":"movie","DVD":"22 Aug 1997","BoxOffice":"$21,192,102","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
