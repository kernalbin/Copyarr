On Christmas Eve, Scott reads The Night Before Christmas - then receives an unexpected visitor on his roof. When Santa is startled by Scott's calling out and falls, he disappears, leaving only an 8-reindeer sleigh and a suit with instructions to put it on if he's involved in an accident. Scott does, and is transported around the town dropping gifts through chimneys until he's taken to the North Pole and informed by a group, who claim they're elves, that he is now Santa.
