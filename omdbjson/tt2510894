Everything seems to be changing for the better at Hotel Transylvania... Dracula's rigid monster-only hotel policy has finally relaxed, opening up its doors to human guests. But behind closed coffins, Drac is worried that his adorable half-human, half-vampire grandson, Dennis, isn't showing signs of being a vampire. So while Mavis is busy visiting her human in-laws with Johnny - and in for a major cultural shock of her own - \"Vampa\" Drac enlists his friends Frank, Murray, Wayne and Griffin to put Dennis through a \"monster-in-training\" boot camp. But little do they know that Drac's grumpy and very old, old, old school dad Vlad is about to pay a family visit to the hotel. And when Vlad finds out that his great-grandson is not a pure blood - and humans are now welcome at Hotel Transylvania - things are going to get batty!","Language":"English","Country":"United States, Canada","Awards":"3 wins & 11 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGVhZWM0YTEtM2YxYy00YWUzLWI1YWQtNjk5ZTRhNTJmM2VhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTk1MTAyODc@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"55%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"44/100"}],"Metascore":"44","imdbRating":"6.6","imdbVotes":"134,180","imdbID":"tt2510894","Type":"movie","DVD":"12 Jan 2016","BoxOffice":"$169,700,110","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
