Then, one day, he sees her. Tall, with long chestnut hair, a buttery complexion, and big, dark eyes; an enigmatically beautiful girl standing in front of the school's gate, indolently observing people passing by. To get noticed by the distant girl, Raphina, Conor enlists the help of a group of teenage dreamers to form a band--and, surprisingly--with every lyric he writes, the gap narrows, and with every song he plays, her heart brims with affection. Now, before a sea of opportunities, what does the future hold for a brave love like this?","Language":"English, French, Latin","Country":"Ireland, United Kingdom","Awards":"16 wins & 46 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEzODA3MDcxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODgxNDk3NzE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.9/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"95%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"79/100"}],"Metascore":"79","imdbRating":"7.9","imdbVotes":"97,423","imdbID":"tt3544112","Type":"movie","DVD":"26 Jul 2016","BoxOffice":"$3,237,118","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
