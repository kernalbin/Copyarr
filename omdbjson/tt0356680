His ultra-liberal, anti-conventional rustic Connecticut family doesn't exactly warm to the outsider, who despite her best efforts to please the prospective in-laws, looks, sounds, and acts like the conservative bigots they hate, while various Stones have their own problems. Only matriarch Sibyl Stone's unshakable maverick other son Ben gives her a chance, and as Everett won't actively turn against either, she feels more supported by him and a weird romance blossoms. Feeling beleaguered, Meredith calls in help from her easygoing sister Julie, who proves no help to her but soon develops a chemistry with Everett, so everything may now shift if they dare follow their hearts.","Language":"English, American Sign ","Country":"United States, Germany","Awards":"4 wins & 8 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGM1MmRlMzItZjNmMi00NDNlLTgxYjktMzE0OWJmYTk2YTgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.3/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"52%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"56/100"}],"Metascore":"56","imdbRating":"6.3","imdbVotes":"70,869","imdbID":"tt0356680","Type":"movie","DVD":"02 May 2006","BoxOffice":"$60,062,868","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
