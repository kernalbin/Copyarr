Kirk is an instructor at Starfleet Academy and feeling old; the prospect of attending his ship, the USS Enterprise--now a training ship--on a two-week cadet cruise does not make him feel any younger. But the training cruise becomes a deadly serious mission when his nemesis Khan Noonien Singh--infamous conqueror from late 20th century Earth--appears after years of exile. Khan later revealed that the planet Ceti Alpha VI exploded, and shifted the orbit of the fifth planet as a Mars-like haven. He begins capturing Project Genesis, a top secret device holding the power of creation itself, and schemes the utter destruction of Kirk.","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"3 wins & 9 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmZiZmM2OTUtZDlmOC00YzYyLThkMGEtZWFkMjJmM2EwZDVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.7/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"86%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"68/100"}],"Metascore":"68","imdbRating":"7.7","imdbVotes":"125,152","imdbID":"tt0084726","Type":"movie","DVD":"06 Aug 2002","BoxOffice":"$79,707,906","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
