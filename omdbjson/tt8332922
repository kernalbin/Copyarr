Now, 474 days after the all-out alien attack in A Quiet Place (2018), the Abbotts summon up every last ounce of courage to leave their now-burned-to-the-ground farm and embark on a peril-laden quest to find civilization. With this in mind, determined to expand beyond the boundaries, the resilient survivors have no other choice but to venture into eerily quiet, uncharted hostile territory, hoping for a miracle. But, this time, the enemy is everywhere.","Language":"English, American Sign ","Country":"United States","Awards":"Nominated for 1 BAFTA Award14 wins & 44 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTE2ODU4NDEtNmRjNS00OTk1LTg4NmMtNTAzYzVlNzJmYjgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODk4OTc3MTY@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.2/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"91%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"71/100"}],"Metascore":"71","imdbRating":"7.2","imdbVotes":"247,189","imdbID":"tt8332922","Type":"movie","DVD":"13 Jul 2021","BoxOffice":"$160,072,261","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
