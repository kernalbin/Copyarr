Michelle Ashford's script fuses multiple strands and moods: tense, romantic, thrilling, unexpectedly funny, and endlessly surprising. It tells a richly human story of the soldiers we seldom see, who fight a different kind of war in shadows and deception, haunted by the knowledge that certainty and guarantee of success are nowhere to be found.","Language":"English, Spanish","Country":"United Kingdom, United States","Awards":"2 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGZlNjZhNjgtMjQzZC00MDI0LWFmNGQtNmNiYTIyYTE3ODhkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDA4NzMyOA@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"83%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"65/100"}],"Metascore":"65","imdbRating":"6.6","imdbVotes":"30,622","imdbID":"tt1879016","Type":"movie","DVD":"11 May 2022","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
