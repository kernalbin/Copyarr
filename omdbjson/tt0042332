But, once more, things will go from bad to worse, When Cinderella's father, too, dies, leaving her all alone in the Lady's clutches to serve as her maid-of-all-work. Under those circumstances, a shabby and neglected Cinderella doesn't stand much of a chance of attending the King's royal ball--let alone, captivate the handsome Prince--unless she turns to her loving Fairy Godmother who has quite a few tricks up her sleeve. Nevertheless, will the wronged damsel ever find peace--and with it--her own Prince Charming ?","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"Nominated for 3 Oscars. 6 wins & 8 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWE3NzMxZTYtZTUyYi00ZTMzLTg2MzEtZjg0NGM3ZDJjZDg2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDE5MTU2MDE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.3/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"97%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"85/100"}],"Metascore":"85","imdbRating":"7.3","imdbVotes":"166,613","imdbID":"tt0042332","Type":"movie","DVD":"04 Oct 2005","BoxOffice":"$93,141,149","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
