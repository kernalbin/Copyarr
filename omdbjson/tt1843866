That becomes clear when Director Nick Fury is killed by the mysterious assassin, the Winter Soldier, but not before warning Rogers that SHIELD has been subverted by its enemies. When Rogers acts on Fury's warning to trust no one there, he is branded as a traitor by the organization. Now a fugitive, Captain America must get to the bottom of this deadly mystery with the help of the Black Widow and his new friend, The Falcon. However, the battle will be costly for the Sentinel of Liberty, with Rogers finding enemies where he least expects them while learning that the Winter Soldier looks disturbingly familiar.","Language":"English, French","Country":"United States","Awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar. 5 wins & 52 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzA2NDkwODAwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODk5MTgzMTE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.8/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"90%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"70/100"}],"Metascore":"70","imdbRating":"7.8","imdbVotes":"866,915","imdbID":"tt1843866","Type":"movie","DVD":"09 Sep 2014","BoxOffice":"$259,766,572","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
