With no job possibilities on the horizon, the two dads open their own day care facility, \"Daddy Day Care\", and employ some fairly unconventional and sidesplitting methods of caring for children. As \"Daddy Day Care\" starts to catch on, it launches them into a highly comedic rivalry with Chapman Academy's tough-as-nails director, Mrs. Gwyneth Harridan (Anjelica Huston), who has driven all previous competitors out of business.","Language":"English, Klingon, German","Country":"United States","Awards":"1 win & 6 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTZiYjEzY2UtMzA2OC00NjM1LWFlMjItMzg4MTAwOTU2YzYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"27%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"39/100"}],"Metascore":"39","imdbRating":"5.6","imdbVotes":"71,436","imdbID":"tt0317303","Type":"movie","DVD":"24 May 2005","BoxOffice":"$104,297,061","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
