It would be an impossible mission: with the art trapped behind enemy lines, and with the German army under orders to destroy everything as the Reich fell, how could these guys - seven museum directors, curators, and art historians, all more familiar with Michelangelo than the M-1 - possibly hope to succeed? But as the Monuments Men, as they were called, found themselves in a race against time to avoid the destruction of 1000 years of culture, they would risk their lives to protect and defend mankind's greatest achievements.","Language":"English, German, Russian, French, Flemish, Dutch","Country":"Germany, United States","Awards":"3 wins & 3 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMxMjk4NTM1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjg0MjQ3MDE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.1/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"31%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"52/100"}],"Metascore":"52","imdbRating":"6.1","imdbVotes":"134,950","imdbID":"tt2177771","Type":"movie","DVD":"20 May 2014","BoxOffice":"$78,031,620","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
