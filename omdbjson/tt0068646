He is at the event of his daughter's wedding. Michael, Vito's youngest son and a decorated WW II Marine is also present at the wedding. Michael seems to be uninterested in being a part of the family business. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But when a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs and needs the Don's influence for the same, Vito refuses to do it. What follows is a clash between Vito's fading old values and the new ways which may cause Michael to do the thing he was most reluctant in doing and wage a mob war against all the other mafia families which could tear the Corleone family apart.","Language":"English, Italian, Latin","Country":"United States","Awards":"Won 3 Oscars. 32 wins & 31 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2MyNjYxNmUtYTAwNi00MTYxLWJmNWYtYzZlODY3ZTk3OTFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzkwMjQ5NzM@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"9.2/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"97%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"100/100"}],"Metascore":"100","imdbRating":"9.2","imdbVotes":"1,910,007","imdbID":"tt0068646","Type":"movie","DVD":"11 May 2004","BoxOffice":"$136,381,073","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
