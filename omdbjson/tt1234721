Overseas, their drones have been used by the military for years - and it's meant billions for OmniCorp's bottom line. Now OmniCorp wants to bring their controversial technology to the home front, and they see a golden opportunity to do it. When Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) - a loving husband, father and good cop doing his best to stem the tide of crime and corruption in Detroit - is critically injured in the line of duty, OmniCorp sees their chance for a part-man, part-robot police officer. OmniCorp envisions a RoboCop in every city and even more billions for their shareholders, but they never counted on one thing: there is still a man inside the machine pursuing justice.","Language":"English, Persian, Ukrainian","Country":"United States","Awards":"4 wins & 1 nomination","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyOTUzMTcxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjkyOTc1MDE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.2/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"49%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"52/100"}],"Metascore":"52","imdbRating":"6.2","imdbVotes":"233,639","imdbID":"tt1234721","Type":"movie","DVD":"03 Jun 2014","BoxOffice":"$58,607,007","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
