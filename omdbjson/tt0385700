This disease is believed to have been caused by the body fighting off foreign material that invaded the body two years earlier, at the end of \"Final Fantasy VII\". Guilt-ridden and haunted by his past, ex-SOLDIER Cloud Strife has decided to live a secluded, solitary life away from his friends while maintaining \"Strife's Delivery Service\", whose headquarters is located in Tifa Lockheart's bar, the Seventh Heaven.
