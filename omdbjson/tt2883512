Those frustrations boil over into a raucous viral-videoed public confrontation against a restaurant critic who panned his cooking of food that his boss ordered him to make against his instincts. Now with his career ruined, Carl's ex-wife offers an unorthodox solution in Miami: refit an old food truck to offer quality cooking on his own terms. Now with his young son, Percy, and old colleague, Martin, helping, Carl takes a working trip across America with that truck to rediscover his gastronomic passion. With Percy's tech savvy and Martin's enthusiasm, Carl finds that he is creating a traveling sensation on the way home. In doing so, Carl discovers he is serving up more than simply food, but also a deeper connection with his life and his family that is truly delicious in its own way.","Language":"English, Spanish","Country":"United States","Awards":"2 wins & 4 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTQyNDQwMjYtZTY5YS00MGU2LWE5NzctMjM4Y2IyYjkwMjNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTY5Nzc4MDY@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.3/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"87%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"68/100"}],"Metascore":"68","imdbRating":"7.3","imdbVotes":"230,799","imdbID":"tt2883512","Type":"movie","DVD":"16 Sep 2014","BoxOffice":"$31,424,003","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
