By 2012, they are rookie cops, paired together, on bike patrol yearning to make arrests. After a screw up, they're sent undercover back to high school to find the source of a dangerous synthetic drug. They mix up their names, and Schmidt gets the no-brainer classes where he auditions for Peter Pan and falls in love with Wendy; Jenko gets AP classes where he falls in with high-achieving dweebs. This second chance at high school gives Schmidt delusions of grandeur, which threaten the operation. Can they sort out their relationship as they stumble onto the bad guys?","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"11 wins & 21 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTZjNzRjMTMtZDMzNy00Y2ZjLTg0OTAtZjVhNzYyZmJjOTljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODE5NzE3OTE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.2/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"85%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"69/100"}],"Metascore":"69","imdbRating":"7.2","imdbVotes":"598,677","imdbID":"tt1232829","Type":"movie","DVD":"04 Feb 2014","BoxOffice":"$138,447,667","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
