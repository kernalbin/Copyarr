In order to meet her again, Z switches sides with his soldier friend Weaver - only to become a hero in the course of events. By this he unwillingly crosses the sinister plans of ambitious General Mandible (Bala's fianc√©, by the way), who wants to divide the ant society into a superior, strong race (soldiers) and an inferior, to-be-eliminated race (the workers). But Z and Bala, both unaware of the dangerous situation, try to leave the oppressive system by heading for Insectopia, a place where food paves the streets.","Language":"English","Country":"United States, United Kingdom","Awards":"Nominated for 1 BAFTA Award6 wins & 14 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzMzMDdlMDktODg4OC00Y2E5LTk1ZjMtNzM2MzIxZGQ0ZGI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.5/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"92%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"72/100"}],"Metascore":"72","imdbRating":"6.5","imdbVotes":"159,671","imdbID":"tt0120587","Type":"movie","DVD":"07 Jun 2005","BoxOffice":"$90,757,863","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
