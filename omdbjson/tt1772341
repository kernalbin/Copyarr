But they do love heroes... so when a modern, first-person shooter game arrives featuring tough-as-nails Sergeant Calhoun, Ralph sees it as his ticket to heroism and happiness.

Vanellope von Schweetz, a young troublemaking \"glitch\" from a candy-coated cart racing game who might just be the one to teach Ralph what it means to be a Good Guy.
