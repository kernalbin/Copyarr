Withdrawn to the interior of the continents, the human race keeps advancing, reaching the point of creating realistic robots (called mechas) to serve them. One of the mecha-producing companies builds David, an artificial kid which is the first to have real feelings, especially a never-ending love for his \"mother\", Monica. Monica is the woman who adopted him as a substitute for her real son, who remains in cryo-stasis, stricken by an incurable disease. David is living happily with Monica and her husband, but when their real son returns home after a cure is discovered, his life changes dramatically.","Language":"English","Country":"United States, United Kingdom","Awards":"Nominated for 2 Oscars. 17 wins & 71 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWU2NzEyMDYtM2MyOS00OGM3LWFkNzAtMzRiNzE2ZjU5ZTljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0OTQ0OTY@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.2/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"75%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"65/100"}],"Metascore":"65","imdbRating":"7.2","imdbVotes":"314,873","imdbID":"tt0212720","Type":"movie","DVD":"22 May 2006","BoxOffice":"$78,616,689","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
