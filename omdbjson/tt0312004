Suddenly, a huge, mysterious, veg-ravaging \"beast\" begins attacking the town's sacred vegetable plots at night, and the competition hostess, Lady Tottington, commissions Anti-Pesto to catch it and save the day. Lying in wait, however, is Lady Tottington's snobby suitor, Victor Quartermaine, who'd rather shoot the beast and secure the position of local hero-not to mention Lady Tottingon's hand in marriage. With the fate of the competition in the balance, Lady Tottington is eventually forced to allow Victor to hunt down the vegetable chomping marauder. Little does she know that Victor's real intent could have dire consequences for her ...and our two heroes.","Language":"English","Country":"United Kingdom, United States","Awards":"Won 1 Oscar. 41 wins & 25 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmExY2Y3NGQtMzg5ZC00MGY1LTk3ZjktNWYyYzYwMTA1MTUwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjk1Njg5NTA@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.5/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"95%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"87/100"}],"Metascore":"87","imdbRating":"7.5","imdbVotes":"140,498","imdbID":"tt0312004","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"$56,110,897","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
