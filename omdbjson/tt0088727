But they get an unexpected jolt when they're mistakenly sent a girl instead: Anne Shirley. Anne's a dreamer with an unusual point of view, far removed from Marilla's pragmatic ways, and it's only on trial that Marilla agrees to keep Anne...if Anne can keep out of trouble, only Anne has a positive genius for it. As Anne falls into a series of scrapes (and off a roof), makes a bosom friend, searches (and finds) several kindred spirits, Matthew and Marilla discover that their lives have become a great deal richer, now that Anne is at Green Gables.","Language":"English","Country":"Canada, West Germany, United States","Awards":"Won 1 Primetime Emmy. 12 wins & 6 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjBmYjU2YjQtNjc3NS00NmMzLTk3OWUtNDM0ZDEyOGQ4ZWI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzU3MTc5OTE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.5/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"83%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"8.5","imdbVotes":"22,532","imdbID":"tt0088727","Type":"series","totalSeasons":"1","Response":"True"}
