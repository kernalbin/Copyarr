They get the tickets to The Quidditch World Cup Final, but after the match is over, people dressed like Lord Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes') \"Death Eaters\" set a fire to all of the visitors' tents, coupled with the appearance of Voldemort's symbol, the \"Dark Mark\" in the sky, which causes a frenzy across the magical community. That same year, Hogwarts is hosting \"The Triwizard Tournament\", a magical tournament between three well-known schools of magic : Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang. The contestants have to be above the age of seventeen, and are chosen by a magical object called \"The Goblet of Fire\". On the night of selection, however, the Goblet spews out four names instead of the usual three, with Harry unwittingly being selected as the Fourth Champion. Since the magic cannot be reversed, Harry is forced to go with it and brave three exceedingly difficult tasks.","Language":"English, French, Latin","Country":"United Kingdom, United States","Awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar. 13 wins & 44 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1NDMyMjExOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTc4MjQzMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.7/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"88%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"81/100"}],"Metascore":"81","imdbRating":"7.7","imdbVotes":"647,099","imdbID":"tt0330373","Type":"movie","DVD":"07 Mar 2006","BoxOffice":"$290,469,928","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
