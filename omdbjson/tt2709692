{"Title":"The Grinch","Year":"2018","Rated":"PG","Released":"09 Nov 2018","Runtime":"85 min","Genre":"Animation, Comedy, Family","Director":"Yarrow Cheney, Scott Mosier","Writer":"Michael LeSieur, Tommy Swerdlow, Dr. Seuss","Actors":"Benedict Cumberbatch, Cameron Seely, Rashida Jones","Plot":"For their eighth fully animated feature, Illumination and Universal Pictures present The Grinch, based on Dr. Seuss' beloved holiday classic. The Grinch tells the story of a cynical grump who goes on a mission to steal Christmas, only to have his heart changed by a young girl's generous holiday spirit. Funny, heartwarming, and visually stunning, it's a universal story about the spirit of Christmas and the indomitable power of optimism. Academy Award nominee Benedict Cumberbatch lends his voice to the infamous Grinch, who lives a solitary life inside a cave on Mt. Crumpet with only his loyal dog, Max, for company. With a cave rigged with inventions and contraptions for his day-to-day needs, the Grinch only sees his neighbors in Whoville when he runs out of food. Each year at Christmas they disrupt his tranquil solitude with their increasingly bigger, brighter, and louder celebrations. When the Whos declare they are going to make Christmas three times bigger this year, the Grinch realizes there is only one way for him to gain some peace and quiet: he must steal Christmas. To do so, he decides to pose as Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, even going so far as to trap a lackadaisical misfit reindeer to pull his sleigh. Meanwhile, down in Whoville, Cindy-Lou Who (Cameron Seely), a young girl overflowing with holiday cheer, plots with her gang of friends to trap Santa Claus as he makes his Christmas Eve rounds so that she can thank him for help for her overworked single mother. As Christmas approaches, however, her good-natured scheme threatens to collide with the Grinch's more nefarious one. Will Cindy-Lou achieve her goal of finally meeting Santa Claus? Will the Grinch succeed in silencing the Whos' holiday cheer once and for all?","Language":"English","Country":"France, United States","Awards":"2 wins & 18 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmE5Yjg0MzktYzgzMi00YTFiLWJjYTItY2M5MmI1ODI4MDY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.4/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"59%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"51/100"}],"Metascore":"51","imdbRating":"6.4","imdbVotes":"78,090","imdbID":"tt2709692","Type":"movie","DVD":"05 Feb 2019","BoxOffice":"$271,384,731","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
