His life begins to change, however, when he finds out he's on academic probation, and when he stumbles into love with Miss Cross, a pretty teacher of the elementary school at Rushmore. Added to the mix is his friendship with Herman Blume, wealthy industrialist and father to boys who attend the school, and who also finds himself attracted to Miss Cross. Max's fate becomes inextricably tied to this odd love triangle, and how he sets about resolving it is the story in the film.","Language":"English, Spanish, Latin, French","Country":"United States","Awards":"16 wins & 16 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODVhNjAzM2EtMzcyMi00YzA2LWIzMTEtNDYyZTk4MWU4YjBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjk1Njg5NTA@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"90%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"86/100"}],"Metascore":"86","imdbRating":"7.6","imdbVotes":"197,974","imdbID":"tt0128445","Type":"movie","DVD":"30 Aug 2014","BoxOffice":"$17,105,219","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
