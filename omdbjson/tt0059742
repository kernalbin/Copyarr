When Navy Captain Georg Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) writes to the convent asking for a governess that can handle his seven mischievous children, Maria is given the job. The Captain's wife is dead, and he is often away, and runs the household as strictly as he does the ships he sails on. The children are unhappy and resentful of the governesses that their father keeps hiring, and have managed to run each of them off one by one. When Maria arrives, she is initially met with the same hostility, but her kindness, understanding, and sense of fun soon draws them to her and brings some much-needed joy into all their lives - including the Captain's. Eventually he and Maria find themselves falling in love, even though the Captain is already engaged to a Baroness named Elsa and Maria is still a postulant. The romance makes them both start questioning the decisions they have made. Their personal conflicts soon become overshadowed, however, by world events. Austria is about to come under the control of Germany, and the Captain may soon find himself drafted into the German Navy and forced to fight against his own country.","Language":"English, German","Country":"United States","Awards":"Won 5 Oscars. 17 wins & 13 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWFhNjg3YjctMjg2Ny00YjBkLTg5M2EtMTk2MjA1NDY3NzQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA0MTM5NjI2._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.1/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"84%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"63/100"}],"Metascore":"63","imdbRating":"8.1","imdbVotes":"244,524","imdbID":"tt0059742","Type":"movie","DVD":"27 Aug 2002","BoxOffice":"$159,287,539","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
