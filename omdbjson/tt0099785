Then, the next morning, while the rest of the family was in a rush to make it to the airport on time, they completely forgot about Kevin, who now has the house all to himself. Being home alone was fun for Kevin, having a pizza all to himself, jumping on his parents' bed, and making a mess. Then, Kevin discovers about two burglars, Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern), about to rob his house on Christmas Eve. Kevin acts quickly by wiring his own house with makeshift booby traps to stop the burglars and to bring them to justice.","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"Nominated for 2 Oscars. 11 wins & 6 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzFkM2YwOTQtYzk2Mi00N2VlLWE3NTItN2YwNDg1YmY0ZDNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.7/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"66%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"63/100"}],"Metascore":"63","imdbRating":"7.7","imdbVotes":"604,127","imdbID":"tt0099785","Type":"movie","DVD":"07 Dec 2004","BoxOffice":"$285,761,243","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
