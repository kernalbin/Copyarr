It's a place rigged with hundreds of social landmines, not the least of which are morons, wedgies, swirlies, bullies, lunchtime banishment to the cafeteria floor - and a festering piece of cheese with nuclear cooties. To survive the never-ending ordeal and attain the recognition and status he feels he so richly deserves, Greg devises an endless series of can't-miss schemes, all of which, of course, go awry. And he's getting it all down on paper, via a diary - \"it's NOT a diary, it's a journal!\" Greg insists, preferring the less-sissyfied designation - filled with his opinions, thoughts, tales of family trials and tribulations, and (would-be) schoolyard triumphs. \"One day when I'm famous,\" writes Greg, \"I'll have better things to do than answer people's stupid questions all day.\" So was born the Wimpy Kid's diary.","Language":"English, German","Country":"United States, United Kingdom","Awards":"5 wins & 9 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3NzQ2NDgyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDc1NzIyMw@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.2/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"54%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"56/100"}],"Metascore":"56","imdbRating":"6.2","imdbVotes":"53,889","imdbID":"tt1196141","Type":"movie","DVD":"03 Aug 2010","BoxOffice":"$64,003,625","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
