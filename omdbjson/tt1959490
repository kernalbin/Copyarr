As the telling continues, we learn how Adam and Eve's sins have passed down through generations through their sons Cain and Abel, and how the descendants of their righteous sibling Seth were entrusted with defending creation. One day, while foraging in the country, a descendant of Seth, Noah, sees his father slain by a descendant of Cain. In the process, Noah's birthright is stolen from him. Decades later, as a father of three, Noah experiences a vision foretelling the great flood that will wash over the Earth, destroying every living thing that stands on the soil. That vision leads Noah to seek out his grandfather, Methuselah (Sir Anthony Hopkins), in order to understand his mission. When a second vision reveals that Noah is to construct a massive ark designed to shelter every living animal during the great flood, Noah, his wife Naameh (Jennifer Connelly), their three sons Shem (Douglas Booth), Ham (Logan Lerman), and Japheth (Leo McHugh Carroll), and their adoptive sister Ila (Emma Watson) immediately begin construction on the vessel with the help of the Watchers, a race of angels created as beings of light, but encrusted in stone and mud and forsaken by God for their attempts to help man. Meanwhile, word of Noah's work soon reaches Tubal-cain (Ray Winstone), who gathers an army on a mission to overtake the ark, and survive the coming storm by any cost.","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"1 win & 19 nominations","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI2OTgyNTc0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDM1NTQxMTE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.8/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"75%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"68/100"}],"Metascore":"68","imdbRating":"5.8","imdbVotes":"260,779","imdbID":"tt1959490","Type":"movie","DVD":"29 Jul 2014","BoxOffice":"$101,200,044","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
