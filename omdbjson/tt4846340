Based on the unbelievably true life stories of three of these women, known as \"human computers\", we follow these women as they quickly rose the ranks of NASA alongside many of history's greatest minds specifically tasked with calculating the momentous launch of astronaut John Glenn into orbit, and guaranteeing his safe return. Dorothy Vaughan, Mary Jackson, and Katherine Gobels Johnson crossed all gender, race, and professional lines while their brilliance and desire to dream big, beyond anything ever accomplished before by the human race, firmly cemented them in U.S. history as true American heroes.","Language":"English","Country":"United States","Awards":"Nominated for 3 Oscars. 37 wins & 94 nominations total","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg2Mzg4YmUtNDdkNy00NWY1LWE3NmEtZWMwNGNlMzE5YzU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjA5MTIzMjQ@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.8/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"93%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"74/100"}],"Metascore":"74","imdbRating":"7.8","imdbVotes":"241,010","imdbID":"tt4846340","Type":"movie","DVD":"11 Apr 2017","BoxOffice":"$169,607,287","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
